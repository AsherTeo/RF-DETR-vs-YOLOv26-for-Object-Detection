# Introduction

YOLO-based detectors are widely used in object detection because of their real-time inference speed and strong accuracy.  
While transformer-based detectors have been proposed as alternatives, they typically introduce higher computational cost and slower inference.

Recent developments such as RF-DETR demonstrate that transformer-based models can achieve high mAP while maintaining efficient inference speed.  
This project explores and compares the performance of RF-DETR and YOLOv26 across five datasets using a unified experimental setup.
